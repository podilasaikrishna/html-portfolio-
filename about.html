<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a second-year BTech student passionate about computer science and software development. 
  Over the past year, I’ve been building a strong foundation in programming with C, Python, and a bit of Java. 
  I’ve also explored core subjects like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA), 
  Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Design Thinking, which have helped me develop both technical and problem-solving 
  skills.</p>

<p>Alongside my academic journey, I’m currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development course to expand my expertise in both 
  frontend and backend technologies. I'm learning modern tools and frameworks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and 
  databases to develop real-world applications. This complements my existing skills in C and Python and aligns with my goal to 
  become a versatile software developer capable of working across the tech stack.</p>

<p>I enjoy exploring how technologies work behind the scenes, whether it's understanding how the internet functions, 
  building user-friendly web apps, or solving algorithmic challenges. I believe in learning by doing, and I’m eager to 
  take on internships, collaborative projects, and challenges that push my limits. I'm looking forward to connecting with 
  professionals, mentors, and peers who share a passion for building impactful tech solutions.</p>
